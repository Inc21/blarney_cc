# Blarney Cycling Club

Blarney cycling club is a website for real life cycling club based in Blarney, Co. Cork. Blarney CC mainly caters for all different types of cycling with a main emphasis on road cycling. Club was founded in 1886 and has been quite active in the community ever since. The club organizes one sportiff/charity cycle and three or more road racing events every year. This website will be a very useful contact point for people not on social media. Also great advertisement and information point for the events coming up or new cyclists hoping to contact the club.

# Design

## Colour
For this, well-established cycling club it was important to pick colours that are consistent with their original club logos and cycling kit.<br>
The two main colours are Tory Blue and Persian Red 

<img src="assets\readme_images\color_pallette.png" alt="Color Pallette" width="500px"><br>
<img src="assets\readme_images\tory_blue.png" alt="Tory Blue" width="250px">
<img src="assets\readme_images\persian_red.png" alt="Persian Red" width="250px">

<br clear="left"/>

## Font
Used Google fonts to import the font styles and <a href="https://fontjoy.com/" target="_blank">fontjoy.com</a> for pairing the fonts.
<br>

### Features Left to Implement

- Full club history page. The club historian has been collecting old photos and articles and the history page would be a great way to publicize this.
- Events page. As mentioned earlier Blarney CC is very active and runs many events. This page would be a very valuable place for marketing these events and for users to find more info about the event.
- Registration page for events.

## Testing 

This website was tested on as many different devices as I was able to find. Including a laptop, desktop pc, two different iPads, and three different versions of mobile phones. I Used a program called [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check for any spelling or typing errors. Clicked all the links and made sure that they are pointing to the right page and that they open in a new window. Filled out the form to confirm that it is functioning as intended. Additionally conducted Google lighthouse and W3C validator testing, results for them are below.
  Also made sure that the website is clear, easy to use and valuable for the user.


- This website was created with few colors and no big pictures. This makes this page very easy on the eyes of the end user.

- Also used Google dev tools to test responsiveness on smaller screens and with throttling on for low-end and mid-tier mobiles. The website was able to load with no considerable page loading times even on low-end mobile.

## Look and feel
  - The look of this website is very consistent in all different browsers tested


## Interesting bug or problems.
  - An existing logo that had to be used for this website meant that the colours that I could use were very limited. This and my lack of experience in design and coding made this project an interesting problem that had to be solved.
  - Used css grid for the layout. Trying to match different elements on the page was a big learning curve.
  - Another interesting problem to solve was getting labels on the form page to render on top of input fields.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - Some errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html). Mainly typing mistakes, elements left open or closed with double marks. All errors were immediately fixed. 
- CSS
  - Some errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css). All errors were immidiately fixed.
