# Blarney Cycling Club

Blarney cycling club is a website for real life cycling club based in Blarney, Co. Cork. Blarney CC mainly caters for all different types of cycling with a main emphasis on road cycling. Club was founded in 1886 and has been quite active in the community ever since. The club organizes one sportiff/charity cycle and three or more road racing events every year. This website will be a very useful contact point for people not on social media. Also great advertisement and information point for the events coming up or new cyclists hoping to contact the club.

The two main colours are Tory Blue and Persian Red

## Interesting bug or problems.
  - An existing logo that had to be used for this website meant that the colours that I could use were very limited. This and my lack of experience in design and coding made this project an interesting problem that had to be solved.
  - Used css grid for the layout. Trying to match different elements on the page was a big learning curve.
  - Another interesting problem to solve was getting labels on the form page to render on top of input fields.
  - Blarney Cycling Club had two Twitter accounts, during the final stages of testing account that was linked on this website was deleted. All pages are updated with the correct url.
  - Another problem discovered during my local testing with different iPhones and iPads, was the logo image not resizing correctly when you turn the phone horizontally. It was like some bottom part of the image was cut off. Quite happy about the solution. Did some searching on the web for potential solutions and I could see this question asked before. I could only test this on the live site so had to do a few commits to get this right. Found no solution but it got me thinking. My solution was, the original logo was 1100x800px and only needed it to be 130px at the highest so resized the image locally and did a commit. Problem still exsisted. After looking at this with dev tools looked like the image was hidden behind a white margin. Assigned position relative and z-index to the container and the problem was solved.


## Unfixed Bugs

After rigorous testing with various online tools and my limited testing with different devices and browsers, all known warnings and errors returned were rectified.
